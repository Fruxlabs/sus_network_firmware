# sus_network_firmware
Decrypted vxworks network firmware for a certain sus vendor. This may be decompiled/ reverse engineered for the inclined, pretty sure this is backdoored. The binary files were dumped from actual running hardware, remotely. You may want to use the latest binwalk to extract/ explore this and reverse it using ghidra/ ida (default mips probably, haven't started reversing it as never got time. Thanks, remote work!), though YMMV.

In case of any issues, you may reach me out at rishabh@fruxlabs.com .
